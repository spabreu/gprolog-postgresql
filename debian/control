Description: PostgreSQL interface for the Contextual GNU Prolog compiler.
 GProlog-PostgreSQL is a low-level GNU Prolog binding for accessing
 PostgreSQL.  This package is not really meant to be used directly but rather
 as a building block for higher-level language processors such as ISCO
 (package forthcoming).
